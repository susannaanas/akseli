<p>Akseli Gallen-Kallela (1865â€“1931) is one of Finland's most renowned artists. He was active during a period when Finland was part of the Russian Empire, and a sense of Finnish national identity was still being built. The central themes of his work were Finnish nature, people and the national epic Kalevala.</p>
<p>Gallen-Kallela was a citizen of the world, and his art was influenced by his studies in Paris, and several trips and residences in Europe, as well as travels in Africa and America.</p>
<p>At the turn of the 20th century, many artists were inspired by exotic far-away countries, such as India, Brazil and the African nations. They believed they would find liberation from the shackles of Western culture.</p>
<p>In 1909 Gallen-Kallela and his family travelled to East-Africa, in what is now known as Kenya. The family's life was filled with painting, photography, the collection of natural and ethnographic artifacts as well as safaris. Kenya left a deep impression on the Gallen-Kallela family. After returning to Finland, they often yearned to return.</p>
